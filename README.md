#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

   Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles,methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality and software systems.
   its important in creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life like in communication,commerce and healthcare.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The birth of structured programming.
   this emerged as a response to the software crisis where increasingly complex software systems became difficult to manage and maintain thus emphasizing the use of clear,hierarchical 
   control structures like loops,conditionals and subroutines.
2. Introduction of Object- Oriented Programming.
   Object-Oriented programming introduced the concept of objects which are instances of classes thst encapsulate data and behavior.This paradigm encourages code reuse,modularity and 
   abstaraction through the use of inheritance,polymorphism and encapsulation.
3. The rise of Agile Methodologies.
   Agile methodologies such as Scrum and Extreme Programming(XP), emerged as a response to the limitation of traditional,heavyweight development models like waterfall. Agile emphasizes 
   iterarives development, customer collaboration and flexibility in response to changing requirements.   

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement Analysis.
   This is where the where the software are gathered from stakeholders and analysed to understand what software needs to do,this involves creating detailedspecifications that will guide 
   the design and develpopment process.
2. System Design.
   Based on the requirements gathered, the system architecture and design are created. This includes defining the overall system architecture, data flow diagrams, database design and 
   detailed design of each module.
3. Coding.
   In this phase, the developer writes the actual codes based on the design documents. the software is built and different modules are intergrated to form a complete sysstem.
4. Testing.
   Once the software is developed, it is tested to identify and fix any defects or issues ensuring its intended functionality.
5. Deployment.
   After succesful testing , the software is deployed to a production environment where it becomes available for use. T his phase may also involve training and documentation of the 
   software's operations.
6. Maintanance.
   This is the phase where the software is updated to adapt to changes, fix any new bugs or add new features ensuring a smooth functioning and relevance over time.
   Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software DEveloper.
  Role- Coding and Implementation.
  Responsibility- Writting clean, efficient and well documented code that translates software design into functional software.
Quality Assurance Engineer.
  Role- Testing and Validation.
  Responsibility- Ensures that the software meets the required standards before it is released to the users, this involves designing, developing and executing test plans ans test cases 
  to identify bugs, defects, or any inconsistencies in the software.
Project Manager.
  Role- Project Planning and Coordination.
  Responsibility- Overseers the entire software development project from inception to completion, this includes creating a detailed project plan, defining the scope, setting timeline and 
  allocating resources effectively.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated Development Environments(IDEs)
  This combines various tools and features that streamline coding, debugging and testing processes within a single interface.
Importance.
 - Enhanced Productivity. Features like synax highlighting, code completion and templates that speed up the coding process. Example; Visual Studio.
 - Intergrated Debugging and Testing. The built in debugging tools allows developers to set breakpoints, inspect variables and step through code to identify and fix bugs.Example; Eclipse.
 - Code Management and Naviagtion. Offers features for navigating large codebases making it easier to manage complex projects and understand the relationship between different parts of 
   code. Example; JetBrains IntelliJ.
 - Support for Multiple Language and Frameworks. This allows programmers to work on various types of projects within the same enveironments. Example; Pycharm, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Version Control S ystems.
  This are tools that manage changes to source code over time, allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project, track changes and revert to previous versions when necessary.
Importance.
 - Collaboration and Team work. It allows various developers to work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. Example; Git.
 - History and Versioning. Keeps a detailed history of all changes made to the codebase allowing developers to track who made changes, why and when. Example; Subversion(SVN).
 - Branching and Merging. Suports the creation of branches which allows developers to work on different features or bug fixes independently of the main codebase. Example; Git.
 - Backup and Recovery. Provides a secure backup of the entire codebase, in the event of data loss, the code can be recovered from the VCS. Example; Mercurial.
   

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Frequent changes in requirements can disrupt the development process, leading to scope creep and rework.
   Strategy; Implement Agile Methodologies such as Scrum or kanban to handle changes iteratively and Maintain clear communication with stakeholders to understand their needs and manage 
             expectations effectively.
2. Accumulation of technical debt leading to poor code quality, increased maintanance cost and difficulties in adding new features.
   Strategy; Regular refactoring by aallocating time for the refactoring code and adressing technical debt in each development cycle and also Implementing Code Reviews by conducting 
             regular code reviews to catch issues early and ensure adherance to coding standards.
3. Managing and understanding the codebase incase of growth in complexity of systems.
   Strategy; Use of modular design and adopting  up do date documentation practices to help developers understand the system design, decision and codebase.
4. Ensuring comprehensive testing and high quality software can be difficult, especially with tight deadlines and complex systems.
   Strategy; Implementation of automated testing framework to run unit tests, intergration tests and regression tests consistently and Adoption of Continuous Intergration/Continuous 
             Deployment(CI/CD) pipelines to automate the build, test and deployment processes.
5. Meeting project deadlines can be difficult due to unexpected issues, scope changes or overestimation of effort required.
   Strategy; Employ project management techniques such as Agile and Waterfall depending on the project needs and Focus on the high-priority tasks and deliverables first using tools like 
             Gantt charts or kanban boards to track progress and manage deadlines effectively.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing involves testing individual components or modules of the software in isolation
   Importance;- Enables early detection and fixing of issues reducing the cost of fixing bugs later.
              - Improves Code quality as writting unit tests encourages developers to create modular and maintanance codes.
2. Intergration Testing focuses on verifying the interactions and data flow between intergrated components or modules.
   Importance;- Helps identify problems related to the interaction between different modules or services which might not be apparent during unit testing.
              - Validates that different parts of the application work together seamlessly.
3. System Testing involves testing the entire software application as a whole to verify that it meets the specified requirements and functionality in a complete intergrated environment.
   Importance;- Validates End-to-End Functionality ensuring that the system behaves as expected covering al intergrated components and their interactions.
              - Checks for compliances to verify that the software meets all the functional and non-functional requirements including perfomance, security and usability.
4. Acceptance Testing is often perfomed by the end user or client asssssing whether the software meets the business requirements and is ready for deployment.
   Importance;- Ensures users satisfaction.
              - Confirms the readiness of the software release confirming if the software meets all the criteria specified in the acceptance criteria or contract.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  It refers to the practice of designing and refining prompts to interact effectively with AI models, particularly language models, it involves crafting questions, instructions or other 
  types of inputs to guide the model's responses in a way that achieves the desired output.
Importance;- Improves Model Accuracy and Relevance, Well designed prompts can help AI models understand and respond more accurately to user queries.
           - Enhances User Experience, Effective prompts can lead to more natural and useful interactions with AI models, by crafting prompts that elicit clear and informative 
             responses,users can have a smoother and more engaging experience.
           - Guides Model behavior and tone,by specifying the desired tone and format, users can tailor the model's outputs to fit specific contexts or audiences.
           - Facilitates Complex Task Execution,prompts help break down instructions into manageable components making it easier for the model to provide comprehensive and structured 
             outputs.
          - Enables Creative and Flexible use cases by allowing users to explore innovative applications of AI models by experimenting with different types of prompts to achieve a 
            diverse outcomes from problem-writting to problem-solving.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt -Banana and peanut butter.
Improved Prompt - What are the health benefits of banana and peanutt butter smoothie?
  The improved version is more effective as it clearly states the information scope needed by the user.
